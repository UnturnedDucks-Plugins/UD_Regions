# UD_Regions
Rebuild of RocketRegions by Trojaner, 
https://github.com/Trojaner/Rocket-Regions

## Due to similarities with RocketRegions, the following restrictions must apply:
*Not allowed:*
- You are not allowed to create a plugin which uses UD_Regions or RocketRegions API (for example which adds flags) and sell it without written permission from Trojaner.
- You are not allowed to copy code of Rocket-Regions and use it in a commercial plugin without written permission from Trojaner.
- You are not allowed to sell modified versions of UD_Regions or RocketRegions without written permission from Trojaner.

*Allowed:*
- You are allowed to create a free and open source AGPLv3 compatible plugin which uses Rocket-Regions API (for example which adds flags) as long as you do not sell it.
- You are allowed to create a free and open source AGPLv3 compatible modified version of Rocket-Regions as long as you do not sell it. It must have the same restrictions as specified here. 
- You are allowed to use UD_Regions or RocketRegions code in free and open source non-commercial AGPLv3 compatible projects. If the project is too similiar to Rocket-Regions, the "modified version" rule will apply (so it must have same restrictions in that case).
